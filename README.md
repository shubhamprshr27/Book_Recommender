# Book_Recommender
A simple project that gives out book recommendations.

The goal of this project was to combine Image processing with concepts of Web Mining.
The Project is able to extract titles from simple images and give book recommendations from the Kmeans clustered dataset that has been scraped from Goodreads.com .
